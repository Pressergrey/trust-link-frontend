# Contributing to TrustLink — Frontend

Thank you for contributing to TrustLink's frontend! This is the layer that real buyers and vendors interact with — the place where blockchain complexity disappears and trust becomes a feeling, not a technical argument.

Whether you're fixing a broken button on mobile, building a new dashboard page, or writing tests for a tricky wallet flow — your contribution has a direct impact on people's ability to transact safely.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind, be constructive, and assume good intent. This project is built for social commerce communities in emerging markets — many of our future users are not technical. Design and code decisions should reflect that empathy.

Condescension, harassment, or gatekeeping will not be tolerated.

## 🌊 Stellar Wave Program

This repository is part of the **[Stellar Wave Program](https://www.drips.network/wave/stellar)** — a funded open-source sprint program by the Stellar Development Foundation. Contribute to labelled issues during an active Wave cycle and earn XLM rewards.

### How to Participate

1. Browse [`Stellar Wave`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22Stellar+Wave%22) and [`good first issue`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels
2. Log into [drips.network/wave](https://www.drips.network/wave) with your GitHub account
3. Apply to an issue — describe your approach briefly in the application
4. Once assigned, open a PR before the Wave cycle ends
5. Earn Points → earn rewards

### Point Values

| Label | Points | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `complexity: trivial` | 100 pts | Small UI fix, missing label, copy change |
| `complexity: medium` | 150 pts | New component, bug fix, unit test suite |
| `complexity: high` | 200 pts | Full page implementation, major refactor, new integration |

> ⚡ Apply early during a Wave cycle. Maintainers assign contributors fast — don't apply without your dev environment ready to go.

## Before You Start

### Find an Issue

- **First-time contributor?** → [`good first issue`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labels are pre-scoped with full context. You won't need to read the entire codebase.
- **Comfortable with React/Next.js?** → [`complexity: medium`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22complexity%3A+medium%22) issues are good next steps.
- **Want to go deep?** → Check the roadmap in the README or look for [`complexity: high`](../../issues?q=label%3A%22complexity%3A+high%22) issues.
- **Have your own idea?** → Open a [GitHub Discussion](../../discussions) before building. We want to merge your work — not close it because of overlap.

### Before Picking Up an Issue

- Check the issue for an existing linked PR — someone may already be working on it.
- Read any maintainer comments in the thread — the scope may have evolved.
- If your approach is non-obvious, leave a comment outlining it first. A quick ✅ from a maintainer saves you from building the wrong thing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | `18.17+` | Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions |
| npm / pnpm | latest | pnpm preferred for speed |
| Freighter Wallet | latest | [freighter.app](https://freighter.app) — install the browser extension |
| Git | latest | |

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trustlink-frontend
cd trustlink-frontend

# 2. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-org/trustlink-frontend

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local — the testnet values are pre-filled for local dev

# 5. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app should load with testnet configuration.

### Connecting to Testnet

For wallet-connected features, you'll need:
1. Freighter extension installed and set to **Testnet**
2. A funded testnet account — use [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/) with your Freighter public key
3. The TrustLink backend running locally (see [trustlink-backend](https://github.com/your-org/trustlink-backend)) — or point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the shared dev environment

### Staying in Sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

**Key rules:**
- `components/ui/` — These are generated by shadcn/ui. Don't edit them directly. Add custom variants in a wrapper component.
- `app/api/` — Server-only code. Never import browser APIs or Freighter here.
- `lib/stellar/` — Keep Stellar SDK logic here. Pages and components should never import `stellar-sdk` directly.

## Making Changes

### Branching

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

| Branch type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | `feat/short-description` | `feat/qr-code-on-link-success` |
| Bug fix | `fix/short-description` | `fix/payment-form-mobile-overflow` |
| Tests | `test/short-description` | `test/wallet-hook-unit-tests` |
| Accessibility | `a11y/short-description` | `a11y/dispute-form-aria-labels` |
| Docs/copy | `docs/short-description` | `docs/update-onboarding-copy` |

---

## Component Guidelines

### General Rules

- Every component must have a clearly typed `props` interface — no `any`
- Use `shadcn/ui` primitives as the foundation — don't reinvent buttons, inputs, or dialogs
- Mobile layout is the primary concern — design for 375px width first, then scale up
- Async data states must always be handled: show a skeleton while loading, show an error state on failure — never leave the user staring at a blank section
- Avoid `useEffect` for data fetching — use the `hooks/` abstractions or React Server Components where possible

### Escrow-Specific UI Rules

- Any page where real money is involved must display a **trust badge** showing the escrow contract address
- State changes (`Funded`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`, `Disputed`) must be communicated with a visible status indicator — not just a console log or toast
- The buyer payment page must show the exact token amount and a breakdown of any fees before the wallet signature prompt

### Example: Adding a New Component

```tsx
// components/escrow/EscrowStatusBadge.tsx

interface EscrowStatusBadgeProps {
  state: EscrowState;
  className?: string;
}

const stateConfig: Record<EscrowState, { label: string; variant: BadgeVariant }> = {
  PENDING:   { label: "Awaiting Payment", variant: "outline" },
  FUNDED:    { label: "Funds Locked",     variant: "secondary" },
  SHIPPED:   { label: "In Transit",       variant: "warning" },
  COMPLETED: { label: "Delivered",        variant: "success" },
  DISPUTED:  { label: "Under Review",     variant: "destructive" },
  REFUNDED:  { label: "Refunded",         variant: "outline" },
};

export function EscrowStatusBadge({ state, className }: EscrowStatusBadgeProps) {
  const { label, variant } = stateConfig[state];
  return <Badge variant={variant} className={className}>{label}</Badge>;
}
```

## Wallet & Blockchain Guidelines

Wallet interactions are the most sensitive part of this codebase. Follow these rules carefully:

- **Never** store a user's private key, seed phrase, or raw secret anywhere — not in state, localStorage, or logs
- All transaction signing must go through `lib/stellar/freighter.ts` — no direct `window.freighter` calls in components
- Always show the user what they're signing in plain language before prompting Freighter
- After a transaction is submitted, poll for confirmation — don't assume it was included in a ledger
- Freighter availability should be checked gracefully — the buyer payment page must degrade if the user doesn't have Freighter installed

```typescript
// ✅ Correct — use the hook abstraction
const { signTransaction, isConnected } = useWallet();

// ❌ Wrong — bypasses error handling and type safety
const result = await window.freighter.signTransaction(xdr);
```

## Testing

```bash
# Unit + component tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
npm run test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# End-to-end tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e
```

### What to Test

- **Hooks** — Test logic in isolation from UI (mock the Stellar SDK)
- **Components** — Test render states: loading, error, empty, populated
- **Forms** — Test validation messages, submission flow, disabled states
- **Wallet flows** — Mock `useWallet` to test connected vs disconnected states

### Example: Testing a Component

```tsx
// __tests__/components/EscrowStatusBadge.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { EscrowStatusBadge } from "@/components/escrow/EscrowStatusBadge";

describe("EscrowStatusBadge", () => {
  it("renders the correct label for FUNDED state", () => {
    render(<EscrowStatusBadge state="FUNDED" />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Funds Locked")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("renders destructive variant for DISPUTED state", () => {
    const { container } = render(<EscrowStatusBadge state="DISPUTED" />);
    expect(container.firstChild).toHaveClass("destructive");
  });
});
```

## Accessibility Standards

TrustLink is used by people across varying digital literacy levels, on a wide range of devices. Accessibility is not optional.

- All interactive elements must be reachable via keyboard (`Tab`, `Enter`, `Space`, `Escape`)
- All form fields must have associated `<label>` elements or `aria-label` attributes
- Color alone must never convey state — always pair with text or an icon
- Minimum contrast ratio: **4.5:1** for normal text, **3:1** for large text (WCAG AA)
- Images and icons must have `alt` text or `aria-hidden="true"` if decorative
- Modal dialogs must trap focus and return focus on close

Run a quick accessibility check before submitting:
```bash
# Install axe CLI (one-time)
npm install -g @axe-core/cli

# Scan a local page
axe http://localhost:3000/pay/test-escrow-id
```
